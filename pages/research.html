# Research

## May 2023 - present: researcher at the Meteorologisk Institutt

Since May 2023, I'm working as a researcher at the Meteorologisk Institutt [ [http](https://www.met.no) ] in Oslo, Norway. I'm developing ensemble-variational methods for the data assimilation system of the AROME-HARMONIE model, within the ACCORD consortium [ [http](http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/accord) ]. I'm also interested in coupled data assimilation and ensemble prediction initialization.

## October 2018 - April 2023: research scientist at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT)

During 5 years, I worked at IRIT [ [http](https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en) ] as a subcontractor (full time) for the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA, Boulder, Colorado) [ [http](https://www.jcsda.org) ]. Within the framework of the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) project, I worked as the lead developer of the System-Agnostic Background Error Representation (SABER) [ [http](https://github.com/JCSDA/saber) ] component that provides generic background error covariance matrices for all JEDI models. My efforts were focussed on the modelling of background error covariances for any kind of grid, particularly within the Background error on Unstructured Mesh Package (BUMP).
 
## April 2016 - September 2018: research scientist at the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM)

At CNRM [ [http](http://www.cnrm-game-meteo.fr/?lang=en) ], I was involved in the development of advanced data assimilation methods combining variational and ensemble aspects, to improve the numerical weather forecasts provided by Météo-France. In particular, I was working on the localisation and hybridisation of sample covariances.

## October 2015 - March 2016: research engineer at the Centre Européen de Recherche et de Formation Avancée en Calcul Scientifique (CERFACS)

Back in France, I temporarily worked at CERFACS [ [http](http://cerfacs.fr/en) ], transitioning to a permanent position at CNRM. I was involved in the linear filtering of sample covariances, with applications related to the variational data assimilation system NEMOVAR. Supervisor : Anthony Weaver

## September 2014 - September 2015: project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

After my PhD, I was hired at NCAR [ [http](http://ncar.ucar.edu/) ] to work on both  theoretical development and pre-operational implementation of advanced data assimilation systems, combining the strengths of variational and ensemble methods. Supervisor: Thomas Auligné.

## September 2010 - August 2014: PhD at CNRM

I did my PhD at the CNRM, supervised by Thibaut Montmerle, Yann Michel and Loïc Berre, and worked on the subject:

<center>*Using ensemble data assimilation for the modelling of flow-dependent background error covariances at convective scale.*</center>

I was granted the Léopold Escande PhD award 2014 from the INP Toulouse [ [http](https://www.calameo.com/read/00477168438af02564f8d) ].
