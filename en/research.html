# Research

## October 2018 - present: senior lecturer at IRIT

I am currently senior lecturer at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse [ [http](https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en) ], located in Toulouse, France. I am working on the modeling of background error covariances for any kind of model grid. My developments are implemented in the **BUMP** code, available in open source [ [http](http://github.com/benjaminmenetrier/BUMP) ].
 
## April 2016 - September 2018: research scientist at CNRM

I worked at the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques [ [http](http://www.cnrm-game-meteo.fr/?lang=en) ], located in Toulouse, France. I was interested in the development of advanced data assimilation methods combining variational and ensemble aspects, to improve the numerical weather forecasts provided by Météo-France. I was especially working on the localization and hybridization of sample covariances.

## October 2015 - March 2016: research engineer at CERFACS

Back from the US, I worked at the Centre Européen de Recherche et de Formation Avancée en Calcul Scientifique [ [http](http://cerfacs.fr/en) ], located in Toulouse, France. I was interested in the linear filtering of sample covariances. Applications were related to the variational data assimilation system NEMOVAR, used to initialize the oceanic forecasting model NEMO [ [http](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/) ].
 
## September 2014 - September 2015: project scientist at NCAR

After my PhD, I was hired at the National Center for Atmospheric Research [ [http](http://ncar.ucar.edu/) ], located in Boulder, Colorado. I was working on both the theoretical development and the pre-operational implementation of advanced data assimilation systems, combining the strengths of variational and ensemble methods.

 
## September 2010 - August 2014: PhD at CNRM

I did my PhD at the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques [ [http](http://www.cnrm-game-meteo.fr/?lang=en) ], located in Toulouse, France. I was supervised by Thibaut Montmerle, Yann Michel and Loïc Berre, and worked on the subject:

<center>*Use of a ensemble data assimilation to model flow-dependent background error covariances at convective scale.*</center>

I was granted the Léopold Escande PhD award 2014 from the INP Toulouse [ [http](https://www.calameo.com/read/00477168438af02564f8d) ].
